### Repo for task scripts and related files submitted for eYantra Robotics Competition under Vitarana Drone theme.
Designed, programmed and implemented a solution to the problem statement pertaining to the VITARANA DRONE theme. Used ROS to simulate drone package deliveries and returns over a spawned arena in Gazebo. Final solution includes PID control over position and attitude, integrated bug algorithm, marker detection, dynamic grid mapping using floating numbers, hybrid A* path planning with smoothening, unique height control navigation algorithm for obstacle avoidance and variable yaw control to optimize the drone's trajectory and speed.

#### This repo was created after the competition ended and final scripts were uploaded for future reference purposes.
